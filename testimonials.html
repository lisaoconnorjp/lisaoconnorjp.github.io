            It has been a whirlwind of happiness and excitement ever since the wedding! <br />
            I wish to express to you that the ceremony that you created for us was more than I had
            ever dreamed of. You have such a beautiful spirit and it shows in your work. You
            certainly chose the right work, or may I say it must have chosen you! <br />
            Words really do not express how thankful I am that you came into our lives. The ceremony

            much interest in our relationship and what made us special and helped us translate that
            into our ceremony. Lisa impressed not only my husband and I but many of our guests made
            positive comments about her calming presence. Lisa also had a wonderful speaking voice,
            soft and calm but also with great emotion clearly heard through the hall by all our
            guests. She made my husband feel comfortable, which wasn't an easy thing to do,
            considering his fear of talking in front of all our guests. She was our best choice of
            people we chose to be part of our wedding. Lisa was our favorite person we worked with
            during our wedding planning! She made our day and the ceremony experience memorable. We
            can't say enough!! She was the one person who was a complete positive experience
            beginning to end. Dedicated, caring, and it is clear she genuinely loves her job!!
            <br />Thank you for all your hard work!! <br /><br />Stephanie and Kevin Crosby <br />-

            Thank you SOOOO much for helping to make our day so special - you and Sheryl were the
            best!!! ...It all worked perfectly...so anyway thank you again so much for everything.
            It went exactly as I planned it and couldn't have been more perfect. If I know of anyone
            in need of a JP you will surely be the first person I recommend : ) <br /><br />Bonnie

            Hi Lisa, <br /><br />
            Thank you for your message. I am very happy that we have you as the justice of the
            peace. It (was) so nice a ceremony, even though it's very small, that we will remember
            forever. Also thanks a lot for your picture of me and Ming walking to the bridge. It's
            very sweet! <br />All the best! <br /><br />CC

            Lisa, <br /><br />Thank you so much for everything. The way you added my dad into our
            wedding ceremony was such an emotional and happy feeling and there are not enough words
            to express how much that means to me. Lisa, you have such a caring heart, it shows you
            do this not just for an income, but also what you feel in your heart. Our Sunset Wedding
            is a memory that will be treasured as a wedding should be, but you just made it that
            much more special considering the circumstances. Lisa I will ALWAYS be grateful for what
            you have done for us. We know that every couple that you marry will feel the same and
            will see what a caring heart you have. Again thank you for the pictures and everything.
            When we can we would love it if you would come and do a ceremony so we can renew our
            vows, a time when my parents can be there. <br />God Bless, Lisa, you truly are a gift
            from God. <br />God Bless, <br /><br />George and Wendy

            ...Everyone really enjoyed your ceremony. I'm sitting here talking with my parents and
            never realized this was the first outdoor, non-church wedding my 84-year old mother has
            ever attended. <br />She loved it! <br /><br />Dave

            Ping and I just want to thank you again for such a wonderful ceremony. Everyone has been
            telling us what a wonderful ceremony it was, and you were a large part of the reason
            why. ...We were very impressed with the way you wove together everything we told you and
            built on it with your own research. Until you said it at the ceremony, I hadn't even
            realized that Kevin was born on Moon Festival! <br /><br />Dave
